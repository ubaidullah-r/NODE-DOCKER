# NODE-DOCKER

This repository contains the code which I am following from the YouTube course "Learn Docker - DevOps with Node.js & Express".

## Project Description

This is a basic Node.js application that uses Docker to create a development environment. The application uses MongoDB as its database and is run inside a Docker container.
